        <p><span>I</span>ndia’s economy continued to expand in the July-September quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of positive
        growth. India’s GDP grew 8.4% on-year basis against a contraction of 7.4% during the same period last year. The growth
        showed that the economy remained on the recovering trajectory during the second quarter. The positive growth was aided
        by the re-opening of India’s economy after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. GDP at constant prices (2011-12)
        in the quarter came in at Rs 35.73 lakh crore, against Rs 32.38 lakh crore in the previous quarter.</p>
