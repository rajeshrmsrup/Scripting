        <p>Twitter co-founder and chief executive officer Jack Dorsey on November 29 stepped down from his position, ending
        his nearly 16-year stint with the social media giant. The company's Board has unanimously appointed Twitter's
        chief technology officer Parag Agrawal as his successor.</p>
        <p>The 45-year-old outgoing CEO expressed faith in his successor, Agrawal, who had joined Twitter in 2011 and was
        appointed as the company's CTO in 2017.</p>
        <p>"My trust in Parag as Twitter's CEO is deep. His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I'm deeply
        grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead," Dorsey said.</p>
